Personal Project
========
Tic-Tac-Toe Chat Website
--------------------
Andy’s Dev Shop will provide Eccleston Inc. with a single page,
multiple view website. The website will allow two users to play
tic-tac-toe and use an online chat feature. The site also registers
new users and authenticates returning users. The website’s backend
will store user data and data generated by game play. The website then
uses backend data to enhance the user experience. Players can compare
their personal scores to their friends and the website’s top players.
The website will provide a fun and interactive web application that
allows players to enjoy the classic game of tic-tac-toe while while
chatting.

to do with my routing in index.js and app.js
